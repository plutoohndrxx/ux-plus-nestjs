Welcome to the **UX Plus NestJS** repository! This project provides a backend development template based on the RESTful API design style and built with the NestJS framework. It integrates essential features like databases (MySQL, MongoDB), caching (Redis), and asymmetric RSA algorithms. With built-in authentication guards and CPU overload protection, this template allows you to focus on your core business development.

## Getting Started üö¶

To get started with **UX Plus NestJS**, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and run the application.

### Installation üîß

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/plutoohndrxx/ux-plus-nestjs.git
   cd ux-plus-nestjs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your database and Redis settings. An example configuration is provided in `.env.example`.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage üìò

Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`. Here are some example endpoints you can test:

- **GET /api/users**: Retrieve a list of users.
- **POST /api/users**: Create a new user.
- **GET /api/users/:id**: Retrieve a user by ID.
- **PUT /api/users/:id**: Update a user by ID.
- **DELETE /api/users/:id**: Delete a user by ID.

Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/plutoohndrxx/ux-plus-nestjs/releases) for more detailed information on each endpoint and how to use them.
